## 3.4 Scope

1. These lines of code are from a REPL session. Is _𝑦_ in scope for _𝑧_?

   ```
   Prelude> let x = 5
   Prelude> let y = 7
   Prelude> let z = x * y
   ```

2. These lines of code are from a REPL session. Is _h_ in scope for function _𝑔_? Go with your gut here.

   ```
   Prelude> let f = 3
   Prelude> let g = 6 * f + h
   ```

3. This code sample is from a source file. Is everything we need to execute _area_ in scope?

   ```
   area d = pi * (r * r)
   r = d / 2
   ```

4. This code is also from a source file. Now are _𝑟_ and _𝑑_ in scope for _area_?

   ```
   area d = pi * (r * r)
      where r = d / 2
   ```

## 3.5 Syntax Errors

Read the syntax of the following functions and decide whether it will compile. Test them in your REPL and try to fix the syntax errors where they occur.

1. `++ [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]`

2. `'<3' ++ ' Haskell'`

3. `concat ["<3", " Haskell"]`

## 3.8 Chapter Exercises

### Reading syntax

1. For the following lines of code, read the syntax carefully and decide if they are written correctly. Test them in your REPL after you’ve decided to check your work. Correct as many as you can.

   a) `concat [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`

   b) `++ [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]`

   c) `(++) "hello" " world"`

   d) `["hello" ++ " world]`

   e) `4 !! "hello"`

   f) `(!!) "hello" 4`

   g) `take "4 lovely"`

   h) `take 3 "awesome"`


2. Next we have two sets: the first set is lines of code and the other is a set of results. Read the code and figure out which results came from which lines of code. Be sure to test them in the REPL.

   a) `concat [[1 * 6], [2 * 6], [3 * 6]]`

   b) `"rain" ++ drop 2 "elbow"`

   c) `10 * head [1, 2, 3]`

   d) `(take 3 "Julie") ++ (tail "yes")`

   e) `concat [tail [1, 2, 3], tail [4, 5, 6], tail [7, 8, 9]]`

   Can you match each of the previous expressions to one of these results presented in a scrambled order?

   a) `"Jules"`

   b) `[2,3,5,6,8,9]`

   c) `"rainbow"`

   d) `[6,12,18]`

   e) `10`

### Building functions

1. Given the list-manipulation functions mentioned in this chap- ter, write functions that take the following inputs and return the expected outputs. Do them directly in your REPL and use the take and drop functions you’ve already seen.

   a)
      ```
      -- Given
      "Curry is awesome"
      -- Return
      "Curry is awesome!"
      ```

   b)
      ```
      -- Given
      "Curry is awesome!"
      -- Return
      "y"
      ```

   c)
      ```
      -- Given
      "Curry is awesome!"
      -- Return
      "awesome!"
      ```
2. Now take each of the above and rewrite it in a source file as a general function that could take different string inputs as arguments but retain the same behavior. Use a variable as the argument to your (named) functions.

3. Write a function of type String -> Char which returns the third character in a String. Remember to give the function a name and apply it to a variable, not a specific String, so that it could be reused for different String inputs, as demonstrated (feel free to name the function something else. Be sure to fill in the type signature and fill in the function definition after the equals sign):
    ```
    thirdLetter ::
    thirdLetter x =
    ```

    ```
    -- If you apply your function to this value:
    "Curry is awesome"
    -- Your function should return `r'
    ```
4. Now change that function so the string operated on is always the same and the variable represents the number of the letter you want to return (you can use “Curry is awesome!” as your string input or a different string if you prefer).
    ```
    letterIndex :: Int -> Char
    letterIndex x =
    ```
5. Using the take and drop functions we looked at above, see if you canw rite a function called rvrs(an abbreviation of‘reverse’ used because there is a function called ‘reverse’ already in Prelude, so if you call your function the same name, you’ll get an error message). rvrs should take the string “Curry is awesome” and return the result “awesome is Curry.” This may not be the most lovely Haskell code you will ever write, but it is quite possible using only what we’ve learned so far. First write it as a single function in a source file. This doesn’t need to, and shouldn’t, work for reversing the words of any sentence. You’re expected only to slice and dice this particular string with take and drop.

6. Let’s see if we can expand that function into a module. Why would we want to? By expanding it into a module, we can add more functions later that can interact with each other. We can also then export it to other modules if we want to and use this code in those other modules. There are different ways you could lay it out, but for the sake of convenience, we’ll show you a sample layout so that you can fill in the blanks:
    ```
    module Reverse

    where rvrs :: String -> String
    rvrs x =

    main :: IO ()
    main = print ()
    ```
    Into the parentheses after print you’ll need to fill in your function name _rvrs_ plus the argument you’re applying _rvrs_ to, in this case “Curry is awesome.” That rvrs function plus its argument are now the argument to print. It’simportant to put them inside the parentheses so that that function gets applied and evaluted first, and then that result is printed.

    Of course,we have also mentioned that you can use the $ symbol to avoid using parentheses, too.Try modifying your main function to use that instead of the parentheses.
