# Exercises

## 2.5 Comprehension Check

1. Given the following lines of code as they might appear in a source file, how would you change them to use them directly in the REPL?

    `half x = x / 2`

    `square x = x * x`

2. Write one function that can accept one argument and work for all the following expressions. Be sure to name the function.

    `3.14 * (5 * 5)`

    `3.14 * (10 * 10)`

    `3.14 * (2 * 2)`

    `3.14 * (4 * 4)`

3. There is a value in Prelude called pi. Rewrite your function to use pi instead of 3.14.

## 2.6 Parentheses and Association

Below are some pairs of functions that are alike except for parenthesization. Read them carefully and decide if the parentheses change the results of the function. Check your work in GHCi.

1. a) `8 + 7 * 9`

    b) `(8 + 7) * 9`
2. a) `perimeter x y = (x * 2) + (y * 2)`

   b) `perimeter x y = x * 2 + y * 2`

3. a) `f x = x / 2 + 9`

    b) `f x = x / (2 + 9)`

## 2.7 Heal the Sick
The following code samples are broken and won’t compile. The first two are as you might enter into the REPL; the third is from a source f ile. Find the mistakes and fix them so that they will.
1. `let area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)`

2. `let double x = b * 2`

3. .
    ```
    x = 7
    y = 10
    f = x + y
    ```

## 2.10 Head Code
Determine in your head what the following expressions will return, then validate in the REPL:
1. `let x = 5 in x`

2. `let x = 5 in x * x`

3. `let x = 5; y = 6 in x * y`

4. `let x = 3; y = 1000 in x + 3`

Rewrite with where clauses:

1. `let x = 3; y = 1000 in x * 3 + y`

2. `let y = 10; x = 10 * 5 + y in x * 5`

3. `let x = 7; y = negate x; z = y * 10 in z / x + y`

## 2.11 Chapter Exercises
### Parenthesization

Given what we know about the precedence of (*), (+), and (^), how can we parenthesize the following expressions more explicitly without changing their results?

1. `2 + 2 * 3 -1`

2. `(^) 10 $ 1 + 1`

3. `2 ^ 2 * 4 ^ 5 + 1`

### Equivalent expressions
Which of the following pairs of expressions will return the same result when evaluated?
1. 1 + 1

    2
2. 10 ^ 2

   10 + 9 * 10

3. 400 - 37

    (-) 37 400

4. 100 `div` 3

    100 / 3

5. 2 * 5 + 18

    2 * (5 + 18)

### More fun with functions
1. Given:
    ```
    z = 7
    y = z + 8
    x = y ^ 2
    waxOn = x * 5
    ```

    Evaluate the following:

    `10 + waxOn == 1135`

    `(+10) waxOn == 1135`

    `(-) 15 waxOn == -1110`

    `(-) waxOn 15 == 1110`

2. Evaluate

    `let triple x = x * 3`

3. Evaluate

    `triple waxOn`

4. Rewrite waxOn as an expression with a where clause

5. Evaluate `triple waxOn` again

6. Add a newfunction called `waxOff x = triple x`

    a) What is the result of waxOff 10 or waxOff (-50)?

    b) Modify your waxOff to first triple the x value and then divide it by 10.
